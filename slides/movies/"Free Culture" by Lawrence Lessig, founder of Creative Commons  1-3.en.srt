1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,850
so I've been doing this for that two

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,490
years would 100 of these gigs this is

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,540
about the last one one more and it's

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,580
over for me

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,799
and I figured that way to write a song

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,990
to end it right but then I realized I

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,770
don't sing and I can't write music but I

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,590
came up with the refrain at least right

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,090
and this captures the point if you

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,439
understand this refrain you're going to

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,390
understand everything I want to say to

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,679
you today has four parts first

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:36,210
creativity and innovation all these

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,309
builds on the past the past always tries

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,120
to control the creativity that builds

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,579
upon it's free societies in a way the

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,600
future by limiting this power of the

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:57,120
past and ours is less and less of free

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:59,129
society 1774 free culture was born in a

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,930
case called Donna's would be Beckett in

21
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,500
the House of Lords in England free

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,369
culture was made because copyright was

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,080
stopped in 1710 the statute of Anne had

24
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,960
said that copy that should be for a

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,259
limited turn just fourteen years but in

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,810
the 1740s when Scottish publishers

27
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,600
started reprinting classics you got to

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,670
love the Scots the London publishers

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,080
said stop they said copyright is forever

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,700
Sonny Bono said copyright should be

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,310
forever - a day but the London

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,530
publishers said copyright is forever

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,259
these publishers people who make him

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,570
referred to as voyage patentees and

35
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,590
monopolizes in the trade of book selling

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,750
men who

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,899
not labour in an honest profession

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,319
except Tim there she is

39
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,149
in that these publishers demanded a

40
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,590
common law copyright that would be

41
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:01,920
forever in 1769 in case called Miller V

42
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,369
Taylor they won their claim but just

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,649
five years later in balancin Miller was

44
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,229
reversed and for the first time in

45
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,680
history the works of Shakespeare were

46
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:17,250
freed freed from the control of a

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,799
monopoly publishers freed culture was

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:25,170
the result of that case remember they

49
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:31,709
were Frank I would sing it but you

50
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:35,489
wouldn't love it too okay that three

51
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:40,049
culture was keyed to America that was

52
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:44,129
our birth 1790 we established a regime

53
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:46,920
that left creativity unregulated now it

54
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:51,569
was unregulated because copyright law

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:55,250
only covered quote printing copyright

56
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:58,260
law did not control derivative work and

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,769
copyright law granted this protection

58
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,049
for the limited time of 14 years that

59
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,470
was our birth and myth fundamentally in

60
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:14,180
1790 because of the technology of the

61
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:16,349
time all things protected with free code

62
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,410
you could take the works of Shakespeare

63
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:22,470
and read the source that source was the

64
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,750
book you could take the lyric of any

65
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,950
creativity protected by the law and

66
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:32,340
understand what made it tick studying it

67
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:35,459
this was the design and the regime and

68
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,620
even in the context of patents there

69
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,269
were transparent technologies you didn't

70
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,819
take you didn't need to take the cotton

71
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,099
gin and read the patent to understand

72
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:50,489
how it works like you could just take it

73
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:53,099
apart these were legal protections in a

74
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,510
context where understanding and learning

75
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:59,959
was still set

76
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:02,599
we control in this culture was tiny I

77
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:08,099
was cute control penny okay

78
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:10,019
and not just then I'd forget the 18th

79
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,120
century the 19th century even at the

80
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:16,919
birth of the 28th 20th century here's my

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:21,540
fifth example here 1928 my hero

82
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:28,830
Walt Disney created this extraordinary

83
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:32,100
work the birth of Mickey Mouse in the

84
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,900
form of Steamboat Willie but what you

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,460
probably don't recognize about Steamboat

86
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,979
Willie and his emergence into Mickey

87
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,570
Mouse is that in 1928 Walt Disney quote

88
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:47,340
to use the language of the Disney

89
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:50,610
Corporation today stole Willie from

90
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,090
Buster Keaton steamed by Bill it was a

91
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,550
parody a take-off it was a daily upon

92
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,310
steamboat bill steamboat bill was

93
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:06,060
produced in 1928 no fourteen years just

94
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:09,210
take it yep mix and burn as he did to

95
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,820
produce the Disney Empire this was his

96
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,039
character Walt's always parroted

97
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,310
feature-length mainstream films to

98
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,950
produce the Disney empire and we see the

99
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,889
product of this this is the Disney

100
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:25,229
Corporation taking works in the public

101
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,410
domain and not even in the public domain

102
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:30,930
and turning it into vastly greater new

103
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:35,310
creativity they took the works of this

104
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,800
guy these guys the Brothers Grimm who

105
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,360
you think are probably great authors on

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,950
their lawn they produce these horrible

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,630
stories these fairy tales which anybody

108
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,820
should keep their children far from

109
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,310
because there are the utterly bloody and

110
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,960
moralistic stories which are not the

111
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,820
sort of thing that children should see

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,520
but then will be told for us by the

113
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,560
Disney Corporation now the Disney

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,740
Corporation could do this because that

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,740
culture lived in a Commons an

116
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,150
intellectual Commons at cultural Commons

117
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,290
where people could feel

118
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:18,210
take and build it was a warrior free

119
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:20,520
jump it is culture that you didn't need

120
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,990
the permission of someone else to take

121
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,860
and build upon that was the character of

122
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,320
creativity at the birth of the last

123
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,050
century it was built on a constitutional

124
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,570
requirement that protection be for

125
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,870
limited times and it was originally

126
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:40,080
limited 14 years if the author lived 28

127
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:43,370
then in 1831 it went to 42 event in 1909

128
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,410
and went to 56 and then magically

129
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:51,690
starting in 1962 look no hands

130
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:54,420
the term expands 11 times in the last 40

131
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,270
years it has been extended for existing

132
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,160
works not just for New York's they're

133
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,990
going to be created but existing works

134
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,270
the most recent is the Sonny Bono

135
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,190
copyright term extension act those of us

136
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,440
who love it know it as the Mickey Mouse

137
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,760
Protection Act which of course every

138
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,070
time Mickey's about the past in the

139
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,660
public domain popular terms are extended

140
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:18,060
and the meaning of this pattern is

141
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,390
absolutely clear to those who pay to

142
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,430
produce it the meaning is no one can do

143
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,740
to the Disney Corporation with Walt

144
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,380
Disney addictive the Brothers Grimm that

145
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,300
they we had a culture where people could

146
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,050
take and build upon what went before

147
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,480
that's over there is no such thing as

148
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,950
the public domain and the minds of those

149
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,990
who have produced these eleven

150
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:46,770
extensions in the last 40 years because

151
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:51,450
now culture is owned okay sorry remember

152
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:54,120
the refrain we always build in the past

153
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,400
the past always tries to stop as freedom

154
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:01,920
of it's about stopping the past but we

155
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:04,500
have lost that ideal his are different

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,110
now from even when Walt produced the

157
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,140
Walt Disney Corporation in this year now

158
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,530
we have a massive system to regulate

159
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,870
creativity a master system of lawyers

160
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,310
regulating creativity as copyright law

161
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,370
has expanded

162
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,170
in unrecognizable forms going from a

163
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,790
regulation of publishing now to a

164
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,380
regulation of copying you know the

165
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,080
things that computers do when you boot

166
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,820
them up going from copies to not just

167
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,280
about copies of the initial work but

168
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,979
even derivative works on top of it going

169
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,020
from 14 years to four new works produced

170
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,640
by a real author there are fewer and

171
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,620
fewer of those people out there life

172
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,020
Plus 70 years

173
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,300
that's the expansion of law but also

174
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,330
there's been an expansion of control

175
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,990
through technology right first of all

176
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:56,070
this reality of opaque creativity you

177
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:58,320
know that as proprietary code creativity

178
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,950
where you don't get to see how that

179
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,640
thing works and the law protects that

180
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,080
thing you can't see it's not Shakespeare

181
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,300
that you can study and understand

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,570
because the code is by nature open

183
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,720
nature has been reformed in our modern

184
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,210
technology technological era so nature

185
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,360
can be hidden and the law still protects

186
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:24,510
it and not just through that protection

187

191
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,220

193
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,520

194
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,130
